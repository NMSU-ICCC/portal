        The International Collaborative Coding Club at New Mexico State University has the goal of helping its members to develop
         the confidence and skills to succeed in their careers as Computer Scientists. 
         In order to achieve this, weekly meetings are held where coding problems are discussed, 
         and mock interviews take place in realistic scenarios. In parallel, different programming projects are developed 
         with relevant technologies and purposes for the participants, with the aim of helping them build their portfolios 
         and getting in touch with the industryâ€™s work standards.
